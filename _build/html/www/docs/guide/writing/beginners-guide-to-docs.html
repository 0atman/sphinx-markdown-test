<div>Camera pans from stage left.
It shows a text editor, open to a blank page.
A person hunched in front, head to desk.</div></blockquote>
<p>The scene above is well known to everyone who writes for a living; the
mixed emotions of a blank page. Full of excitement, fresh with a new
beginning. Yet also full of despair, where do you even start?</p>
<p>I am here to stop this scene from playing out.</p>
<p>This is a guide to documenting your first project. The first time is
always the hardest, and I hope this guide will get you started down the
righteous path. At the end, you should have a project that is ready for
public release.</p>
<p>Feel free to read this document straight through, or simply use it as a
reference.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-write-docs">
<h2>Why write docs<a class="headerlink" href="#why-write-docs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="you-will-be-using-your-code-in-6-months">
<h3>You will be using your code in 6 months<a class="headerlink" href="#you-will-be-using-your-code-in-6-months" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I find it best to start off with a selfish appeal. The best reason to
write docs is because you will be using your code in 6 months. Code that
you wrote 6 months ago is often indistinguishable from code that someone
else has written. You will look upon a file with a fond sense of
remembrance. Then a sneaking feeling of foreboding, knowing that someone
less experienced, less wise, had written it.</p>
<p>As you go through this selfless act of untangling things that were
obvious or clever months ago, you will start to empathize with your
users. If only I had written down why I had done this. Life would be so
much simpler. Documentation allows you to transfer the <em>why</em> behind
code. Much in the same way code comments explain the <em>why</em>, and not the
<em>how</em>, documentation serves the same purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Sidebar on open source</strong></p>
<p>There is a magical feeling that happens when you release your code. It
comes in a variety of ways, but it always hits you the same. <em>Someone
is using my code?!</em> A mix of terror and excitement.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I made something of value!What if it breaks?!I am a real open source developer!Oh god, someone else is using my code..</div></blockquote>
<p>Writing good documentation will help alleviate some of these fears. A
lot of this fear comes from putting something into the world. My
favorite quote about this is something along these lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Fear is what happens when you&#8217;re doing something important.If you are doing work that isn&#8217;t scary,it isn&#8217;t improving you or the world.</div></blockquote>
<p>Congrats on being afraid! It means you&#8217;re doing something important.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-want-people-to-use-your-code">
<h3>You want people to use your code<a class="headerlink" href="#you-want-people-to-use-your-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You have written a piece of code, and released it into the world. You
have done this because you think that others might find it useful.
However, people need to understand why your code might be useful for
them, before they decide to use it. Documentation tells people that this
project is for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If people don&#8217;t know why your project exists,they won&#8217;t use it.If people can&#8217;t figure out how to install your code,they won&#8217;t use it.If people can&#8217;t figure out how to use your code,they won&#8217;t use it.</div></blockquote>
<p>There are a small number of people who will source dive and use any code
out there. That is a vanishingly small number of people, compared to
people who will use your code when properly documented. If you really
love your project, document it, and let other people use it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-want-people-to-help-out">
<h3>You want people to help out<a class="headerlink" href="#you-want-people-to-help-out" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Open source is this magical thing right? You release code, and the code
gnomes come and make it better for you.</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways that open source is amazing, but it doesn&#8217;t exist
outside the laws of physics. You have to put work in, to get work out.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You only get contributions after you have put in a lot of work.You only get contributions after you have users.You only get contributions after you have documentation.</div></blockquote>
<p>Documentation also provides a platform for your first contributions. A
lot of people have never contributed before, and documentation changes
are a lot less scary than code changes. If you don&#8217;t have documentation,
you will miss out on a whole class of contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-makes-your-code-better">
<h3>It makes your code better<a class="headerlink" href="#it-makes-your-code-better" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is an old truth that writing things down helps you think. It&#8217;s
really easy to have an idea in your head that sounds perfect, but the
act of putting words to paper requires a distillation of thought.</p>
<p>Writing documentation improves the design of your code. Talking through
your API and design decisions on paper allows you to think about them in
a more formalized way. A nice side effect is that it allows people to
contribute code that follows your original intentions as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-want-to-be-a-better-writer">
<h3>You want to be a better writer<a class="headerlink" href="#you-want-to-be-a-better-writer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Writing documentation is a different form of writing than most people
have experience with. Technical writing is an art that doesn&#8217;t come
naturally. Writing documentation will start you down the road to being a
better technical writer, which is a useful skill to have as a
programmer.</p>
<p>Writing also becomes easier over time. If you don&#8217;t write for many
months, it is a lot harder to start writing again. Keeping your projects
documented will keep you writing at a reasonable cadence.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-technology">
<h2>What technology<a class="headerlink" href="#what-technology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Starting simple is the best way to achieve actual results. I will
present a well-paved path to walk down, and after you have the basic
idea, you can expand your scope. The tools should be powerful and easy
to use. This removes obstacles to actually putting words on the page.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Sidebar on markup languages.</strong></p>
<p>The examples in this document are both valid
<a class="reference external" href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html#rst-primer">reStructuredText</a>.
reStructuredText is a bit harder to use, but is more powerful. I
recommend that you check them both out, and decide which you want to
use going forward.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="version-controlled-plain-text">
<h3>Version controlled plain text<a class="headerlink" href="#version-controlled-plain-text" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As programmers we live in a world of plain text. Our documentation
tooling should be no exception. We want tools that turn plain text into
pretty HTML. We also have some of the best tooling available for
tracking changes to files. Why would we forgo using those tools when
writing documentation? This workflow is powerful, and familiar to
developers.</p>
</div>

<p>This will render into a header, with a list underneath it. The URLs will
be hyperlinked automatically. It&#8217;s easy to write, still makes sense as
plain text, and renders nicely into HTML.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="readme">
<h3>README<a class="headerlink" href="#readme" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your first steps in documentation should go into your README. Code
hosting services will render your README into HTML automatically if you
provide the proper extension. It is also the first interaction that most
users will have with your project. So having a solid README will serve
your project well.</p>
<p>Some people even go as far as to <a class="reference external" href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">start your project with a
README</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-to-write">
<h2>What to write<a class="headerlink" href="#what-to-write" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now we&#8217;re getting down to the brass tacks. Making sure that you give
your users all the information that they need, but not too much.</p>
<p>First, you need to ask yourself who you&#8217;re writing for. At first, you
generally just need to appeal to two audiences:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Users</li>
<li>Developers</li>
</ul>
<p>Users are people who simply want to use your code, and don&#8217;t care how it
works. Developers are people who want to contribute back to your code.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-problem-your-project-solves">
<h3>What problem your project solves<a class="headerlink" href="#what-problem-your-project-solves" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A lot of people will come to your docs trying to figure out what exactly
your project is. Someone will mention it, or they&#8217;ll google a phrase
randomly. You should explain what your project does and why it exists.
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.fabfile.org/">Fabric</a> does a great job of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-small-code-example">
<h3>A small code example<a class="headerlink" href="#a-small-code-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Show a telling example of what your project would normally be used for.
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html">Requests</a> does a
great example of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-link-to-your-code-issue-tracker">
<h3>A link to your code &amp; issue tracker<a class="headerlink" href="#a-link-to-your-code-issue-tracker" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>People like to browse the code sometimes. They might be interested in
filing bugs against the code for issues they&#8217;ve found. Make it really
easy for people who want to contribute back to the project in any way
possible. I think the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/index.html">Python
Guide</a> does a good
job with the link to the code portion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="frequently-asked-questions-faq">
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions-faq" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A lot of people have the same problems. If things happen all the time,
you should probably fix your documentation or the code, so that the
problems go away. However, there are always questions that get asked
about your project, things that can&#8217;t be changed, etc. Document those,
and <strong>keep it up to date</strong>. FAQs are generally out of date, but when
done well, they are a golden resource.
<a class="reference external" href="http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cookbook.html">Tastypie</a>
did a great job with this, with their &#8220;Cookbook&#8221; concept.</p>

<h3>Information for people who want to contribute back<a class="headerlink" href="#information-for-people-who-want-to-contribute-back" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>People usually have standards for how they expect things to be done in
their projects. You should document these so that if people write code,
they can do things in the norm of the project. <a class="reference external" href="http://opencomparison.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html">Open
Comparison</a>
does a great job of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation-instructions">
<h3>Installation instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-instructions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once people figure out whether they want to use your code or not, they
need to know how to actually get it and make it run. Hopefully your
install instructions should be a couple lines for the basic case. A page
that gives more information and caveats should be linked from here if
necessary. I think at <a class="reference external" href="http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html">Read the
Docs</a> we do
a good job with this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-project-s-license">
<h3>Your project&#8217;s license<a class="headerlink" href="#your-project-s-license" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>BSD? MIT? GPL? This stuff might not matter to you, but the people who
want to use your code will care about this a whole lot. Think about what
you want to accomplish with your license, and please only pick one of
the standard licenses that you see around the web.</p>
