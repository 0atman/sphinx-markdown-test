**Write the Docs** is a series of conferences and local meetups focused
on documentation systems, tech writing theory, and information delivery.

We consider everyone who cares about communication and documentation and
their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers,
tech writers, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants
people to have great experiences with software.

Our conferences create a time and a place for the global community of
*documentarians* to share information, discuss ideas, and work together
to improve the art and science of documentation.
